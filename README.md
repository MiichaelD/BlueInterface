Hello WORLD;
this app built for android  was made for a class named INTERFACES,
its an adaption of the bluetoothChat demo, but the main fuctionality
is to control another device (arduino for example) via bluetooth.

It has 2 sections one just for lead that represent a face, and the other one
was used to control a remote control car (that used to be wired).
